  <h2>CSC73010 Storage example</h2>
  <p>
    This app shows the use of the <b>File</b> component from ionic native.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will see from the code that the file is read and written as a whole object each time
	a change to data is made.  The file is called people.json and is placed in the
	root directory of persistent storage.
